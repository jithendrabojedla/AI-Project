**Binary Sentiment Classification of IMDB Reviews Using AI Algorithms**

**Project Overview**

This project aims to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative using various Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms. The focus is on sentiment analysis, which is crucial for understanding customer feedback and making data-driven decisions. By leveraging techniques such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LSTM, and BERT, the project explores the accuracy of different models in classifying sentiment from text data.

**Key Features**:

Dataset: IMDB Movie Review Dataset (50,000 reviews) with labels for positive and negative sentiments.

Algorithms Tested:

  LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A deep learning model effective for sequential data.

  BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): A transformer-based model that understands language context bidirectionally.

  Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem.

  Random Forest: An ensemble method using decision trees for classification.

  Decision Trees: A simple yet interpretable model for classification tasks.

  Gradient Boosting: A boosting method that combines multiple weak learners (trees) to form a strong model.

  XGBoost: An optimized gradient boosting model known for its performance.

Data Preprocessing:

Removal of HTML tags, URLs, punctuation, and digits.

Lowercasing, stop words removal, and lemmatization for text standardization.

Tokenization and vectorization using techniques like CountVectorizer.

**Objective**

The goal is to experiment with different models and techniques to compare their effectiveness in classifying movie reviews. By doing so, this project aims to provide a scalable solution for automatic sentiment classification of large datasets like IMDB reviews, making the process faster and more accurate.
